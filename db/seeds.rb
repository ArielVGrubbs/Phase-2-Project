A little disclaimer, I haven't studied Art History or Modern Art or anything like that, so I am not a good source on these matters. But it's not like you should expect to find an expert art analysis on a fake website made for the purpose of showcasing two people's coding abilities. Anyways, back to Leonid Afremov. His amazingly dicstinctive style is so bold, and unlike the popular styles of the modern age, and unlike the styles of just about any age now that I think about it (remember, no formal Art History education), and I have always felt that he is underappreciated among regular people. His art isn't like the snooty modern art that strives to be deep and meaningful while completely avoiding looking good, his art can be enjoyed by anyone who sets their eyes on those bright color combinations. And I don't even know where I'm going with this article, it's go a really weird and even slightly alarming tone. Maybe I should just keep breaking the fourth wall for the rest of this article.
